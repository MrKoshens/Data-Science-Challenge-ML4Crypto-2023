Model Files

This GitHub repository contains three main model files, each based on different machine learning techniques. Here is an overview of these models and their utility:
1. Neural Network Model

    File Name: main.ipynb (or any appropriate file extension)
    Accuracy: A little more than 0.5 (e.g., 0.51)
    Description: This model is built using a neural network-based approach. It has demonstrated the best performance among the three models, making it the main trained model for our task. Neural networks are known for their ability to capture complex patterns and relationships within data.

2. Random Forest Model

    File Name: random_forest.ipynb (or any appropriate file extension)
    Accuracy: About 0.49
    Description: The Random Forest model is based on an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. While it has a decent accuracy of about 0.49, the neural network model outperformed it, so it serves as an alternative or benchmark model.

3. Bagging Model

    File Name: bagging.ipynb (or any appropriate file extension)
    Accuracy: Around 0.5 (e.g., 0.50)
    Description: The Bagging model uses an ensemble of various classifiers, including RandomForest, GradientBoosting, LogisticRegression, SVC, and a VotingClassifier. This ensemble approach combines the strength of multiple models, aiming to improve overall performance. While its accuracy is around 0.5, it is considered a robust model.

How to Use the Models

    To make predictions using these models, you can load the respective model file and apply it to new data.
    You may use libraries like Scikit-Learn (joblib or pickle) or TensorFlow/Keras (for neural networks) to load and apply the models.
    Ensure that you preprocess your data in a way that is consistent with the data preprocessing used during model training to get accurate predictions.

Dependencies

    Please make sure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed to load and run these models. The primary libraries include Scikit-Learn for the Random Forest and Bagging models and TensorFlow/Keras for the Neural Network model.
